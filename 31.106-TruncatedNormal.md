```python
keras.initializers.TruncatedNormal(mean=0.0, stddev=0.05, seed=None)
```

Initializer that generates a truncated normal distribution.

These values are similar to values from a `RandomNormal` except that values more than two standard deviations from the mean are discarded and redrawn. This is the recommended initializer for neural network weights and filters.

**Arguments**

- **mean**: a python scalar or a scalar tensor. Mean of the random values to generate.
- **stddev**: a python scalar or a scalar tensor. Standard deviation of the random values to generate.
- **seed**: A Python integer. Used to seed the random generator.
