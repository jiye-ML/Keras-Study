## InceptionV3

```python
keras.applications.inception_v3.InceptionV3(include_top=True, weights='imagenet', input_tensor=None, input_shape=None, pooling=None, classes=1000)
```

Inception V3 model, with weights pre-trained on ImageNet.

This model and can be built both with `'channels_first'` data format (channels, height, width) or `'channels_last'` data format (height, width, channels).

The default input size for this model is 299x299.

### Arguments

- include_top: whether to include the fully-connected layer at the top of the network.
- weights: one of `None` (random initialization) or `'imagenet'` (pre-training on ImageNet).
- input_tensor: optional Keras tensor (i.e. output of `layers.Input()`) to use as image input for the model.
- input_shape: optional shape tuple, only to be specified if `include_top` is `False` (otherwise the input shape has to be `(299, 299, 3)` (with `'channels_last'` data format) or `(3, 299, 299)`(with `'channels_first'` data format). It should have exactly 3 inputs channels, and width and height should be no smaller than 75. E.g. `(150, 150, 3)` would be one valid value.
- pooling: Optional pooling mode for feature extraction when `include_top` is `False`.
  - `None` means that the output of the model will be the 4D tensor output of the last convolutional layer.
  - `'avg'` means that global average pooling will be applied to the output of the last convolutional layer, and thus the output of the model will be a 2D tensor.
  - `'max'` means that global max pooling will be applied.
- classes: optional number of classes to classify images into, only to be specified if `include_top` is `True`, and if no `weights` argument is specified.

### Returns

A Keras `Model` instance.
