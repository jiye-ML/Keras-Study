## MobileNet

```python
keras.applications.mobilenet.MobileNet(input_shape=None, alpha=1.0, depth_multiplier=1, dropout=1e-3, include_top=True, weights='imagenet', input_tensor=None, pooling=None, classes=1000)
```

MobileNet model, with weights pre-trained on ImageNet.

Note that this model only supports the data format `'channels_last'` (height, width, channels).

The default input size for this model is 224x224.

### Arguments

- input_shape: optional shape tuple, only to be specified if `include_top` is `False` (otherwise the input shape has to be `(224, 224, 3)` (with `'channels_last'` data format) or `(3, 224, 224)`(with `'channels_first'` data format). It should have exactly 3 inputs channels, and width and height should be no smaller than 32. E.g. `(200, 200, 3)` would be one valid value.

- alpha: controls the width of the network.

  - If `alpha` < 1.0, proportionally decreases the number of filters in each layer.
  - If `alpha` > 1.0, proportionally increases the number of filters in each layer.
  - If `alpha` = 1, default number of filters from the paper are used at each layer.

- depth_multiplier: depth multiplier for depthwise convolution (also called the resolution multiplier)

- dropout: dropout rate

- include_top: whether to include the fully-connected layer at the top of the network.

- weights: `None` (random initialization) or `'imagenet'` (ImageNet weights)

- input_tensor: optional Keras tensor (i.e. output of `layers.Input()`) to use as image input for the model.

- pooling: Optional pooling mode for feature extraction when

   

  ```
  include_top
  ```

   

  is

   

  ```
  False
  ```

  .

  - `None` means that the output of the model will be the 4D tensor output of the last convolutional layer.
  - `'avg'` means that global average pooling will be applied to the output of the last convolutional layer, and thus the output of the model will be a 2D tensor.
  - `'max'` means that global max pooling will be applied.

- classes: optional number of classes to classify images into, only to be specified if `include_top` is `True`, and if no `weights` argument is specified.

### Returns

A Keras `Model` instance.
