```python
keras.initializers.VarianceScaling(scale=1.0, mode='fan_in', distribution='normal', seed=None)
```

Initializer capable of adapting its scale to the shape of weights.

With `distribution="normal"`, samples are drawn from a truncated normal distribution centered on zero, with `stddev = sqrt(scale / n)` where n is:

- number of input units in the weight tensor, if mode = "fan_in"
- number of output units, if mode = "fan_out"
- average of the numbers of input and output units, if mode = "fan_avg"

With `distribution="uniform"`, samples are drawn from a uniform distribution within [-limit, limit], with `limit = sqrt(3 * scale / n)`.

**Arguments**

- **scale**: Scaling factor (positive float).
- **mode**: One of "fan_in", "fan_out", "fan_avg".
- **distribution**: Random distribution to use. One of "normal", "uniform".
- **seed**: A Python integer. Used to seed the random generator.

**Raises**

- **ValueError**: In case of an invalid value for the "scale", mode" or "distribution" arguments.
