## NASNet

```python
keras.applications.nasnet.NASNetLarge(input_shape=None, include_top=True, weights='imagenet', input_tensor=None, pooling=None, classes=1000)
keras.applications.nasnet.NASNetMobile(input_shape=None, include_top=True, weights='imagenet', input_tensor=None, pooling=None, classes=1000)
```

Neural Architecture Search Network (NASNet) models, with weights pre-trained on ImageNet.

The default input size for the NASNetLarge model is 331x331 and for the NASNetMobile model is 224x224.

### Arguments

- input_shape: optional shape tuple, only to be specified if `include_top` is `False` (otherwise the input shape has to be `(224, 224, 3)` (with `'channels_last'` data format) or `(3, 224, 224)`(with `'channels_first'` data format) for NASNetMobile or `(331, 331, 3)` (with `'channels_last'` data format) or `(3, 331, 331)` (with `'channels_first'` data format) for NASNetLarge. It should have exactly 3 inputs channels, and width and height should be no smaller than 32. E.g. `(200, 200, 3)` would be one valid value.
- include_top: whether to include the fully-connected layer at the top of the network.
- weights: `None` (random initialization) or `'imagenet'` (ImageNet weights)
- input_tensor: optional Keras tensor (i.e. output of `layers.Input()`) to use as image input for the model.
- pooling: Optional pooling mode for feature extraction when `include_top` is `False`.
  - `None` means that the output of the model will be the 4D tensor output of the last convolutional layer.
  - `'avg'` means that global average pooling will be applied to the output of the last convolutional layer, and thus the output of the model will be a 2D tensor.
  - `'max'` means that global max pooling will be applied.
- classes: optional number of classes to classify images into, only to be specified if `include_top` is `True`, and if no `weights` argument is specified.

### Returns

A Keras `Model` instance.
