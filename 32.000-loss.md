## Usage of loss functions

A loss function (or objective function, or optimization score function) is one of the two parameters required to compile a model:

```
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='sgd')
from keras import losses

model.compile(loss=losses.mean_squared_error, optimizer='sgd')
```

You can either pass the name of an existing loss function, or pass a TensorFlow/Theano symbolic function that returns a scalar for each data-point and takes the following two arguments:

- **y_true**: True labels. TensorFlow/Theano tensor.
- **y_pred**: Predictions. TensorFlow/Theano tensor of the same shape as y_true.

The actual optimized objective is the mean of the output array across all datapoints.

For a few examples of such functions, check out the [losses source](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/keras/losses.py).
